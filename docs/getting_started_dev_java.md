## GETTING STARTED WITH THE JAVA SPRINGBOOT APPLICATION

### OVERVIEW

This is a sample Java application showcasing best coding practices and integrating with Azure
and scaffolding for Amido Stacks. This application implements Application Insights for performance management,
and Cosmos DB is used for cloud persistence.

### VERSIONING

This is version `1.0.0` of the `java-stacks` project.

### RUNNING THE APPLICATION LOCALLY

1. Clone the Java project to your local machine from here: [stacks-java repository](https://github.com/amido/stacks-java)
2. Configure required environment variables

    The application is currently configured to work with the Azure environment.

    It uses an Azure **CosmosDB** database to store the example application data. So you should have access to an instance to use with the application.
    Note: For running on a local Windows environment you can use the [Cosmos DB emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator?tabs=ssl-netstd21) (CosmosDB Emulator has a known fixed key).

    In addition, Azure **ApplicationInsights** is used for logging purposes. If this is unavailable, modify the application so that it doesn't fail to startup if it can't access ApplicationInsights, and simply log to the terminal instead.

    There are two corresponding environment variables that need to be set to interact with these systems:

    ```text
    AZURE_COSMOSDB_KEY
    AZURE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY
    ```

    For Unix systems, set them as additional variables within e.g. `~/.profile` or `/etc/profile`.

    For Windows, open System Properties then select the Advanced tab, then click on the Environment Variables button and add the new parameters.

3. Build and run the application

   Note that at a minimum Java 11 should be installed.

    Move to the `<PROJECT-NAME>/java` folder, then

    Unix:

    ```text
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

    Windows:

    ```text
    mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
    ```

4. Verify that the application has started

    Browse to [http://localhost:9000/v1/menu](http://localhost:9000/v1/menu). This should return a valid JSON response.

    The application configuration uses Swagger/OAS3 to represent the API endpoints. The Swagger UI can be viewed by directing your
    browser to [http://localhost:9000/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:9000/swagger/index.html).

### AUTHORIZATION

All API endpoints are (optionally) protected using **Auth0**. There is an `auth.properties` file within the project codebase.
If the following property within this file is set:

```text
auth.isEnabled=true
```

then clients will need to pass an `Authorization` header containing the Bearer token generated from Auth0 as part of the endpoint request. If the value
is set to `false` then no authorization is required.

#### AUTH0 CONFIGURATION PROPERTIES

If using Auth0 for authorization, Auth0 itself will need to be configured with both an API definition and an associated Application.
There are corresponding configuration values required for the Stacks application, within the `auth.properties` file, e.g.

```text
auth0.issuer=https://amidostacks.eu.auth0.com/
auth0.apiAudience=https://amidostacks.eu.auth0.com/api/v2/
```

These parameters are used to verify that the JWT supplied in the Authorization header of a request is valid.

### IDE GUIDELINES

We recommend that you install the following plugins

- Lombok - To reduce the amount of boiler-plate code that needs to be written
- SonarLint - Fix and detect code quality issues (<https://www.sonarlint.org/>)
- Spring Assistant - An IntelliJ plugin for aiding Spring development projects (<https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10229-spring-assistant>)
- Spring Tools - Adds Spring support for IDEs (<https://spring.io/tools>)
- CheckStyle - Flags up issues with coding style (<https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/>)
- google-java-format Formatter - Formats code according to configuration (<https://github.com/amido/stacks-java/blob/master/tools/formatter/intellij-java-google-style.xml>)

### PLUGINS USED IN POM XML

- Lombok - Avoids need to write e.g. Getter, Setter, RequiredArgsConstructor, ToString, EqualsAndHashCode) in Java classes.
- JaCoCo - A free Java code test coverage library.
- Surefire - Used for reporting purposes (creates reports based on tests in the Java test package).
- fmt-maven-plugin - Formats the java code based on rules in java-google-style.xml.
- Spotbugs - Performs a static analysis of the Java code to check for bugs.

### CODE QUALITY

#### FORMATTER

Install the `intellij-java-google-style.xml` formatter configuration file into the IDE from [here](https://github.com/amido/stacks-java/blob/master/tools/formatter/intellij-java-google-style.xml).

The Java source code will automatically be reformatted to comply with the [Google Java Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

You can override the settings locally in the codebase by adding, for example:

```text
//@formatter:off
manually formatted code
///@formatter:on
```

##### VALIDATING AND APPLYING FORMATTING

From the `<PROJECT-NAME>/java` folder run

```text
./mvnw com.coveo:fmt-maven-plugin:check
```

to validate the current formatting. You can then run

```text
./mvnw com.coveo:fmt-maven-plugin:format
```

to apply formatting to the source code.

##### VERIFYING COMMON PROGRAMMING FLAWS

From the `<PROJECT-NAME>/java` folder run

```text
./mvnw spotbugs:check
```

## TESTING

### RUNNING TESTS

Tests within the code are grouped using Tag annotations. There are three groups: 'Unit', 'Component' and 'Integration'. To just run the unit tests, for example, type:

```text
./mvnw test -Dgroups="Unit"
```

Similarly, for the Component tests, you should use:

```text
./mvnw test -Dgroups="Component"
```

and the equivalent for running the Integration tests.

### REPORTS

#### TEST REPORTS

A test report may be created from the `test` package in Java using the Surefire Plugin.
The report file (as either XML or HTML) generated for each of the test classes can be found under `<PROJECT-NAME>/target/surefire-reports`.

Run the following command to create the report:

```text
./mvnw surefire:test
```

To generate the Serenity report:

```text
./mvnw clean verify
```

The report can be viewed under `<PROJECT-NAME>/api-tests/target/site/serenity/index.html`.

#### CODE COVERAGE & DEPENDENCY CHECK REPORTS

Run the following command:

```text
./mvnw jacoco:report
```

The generated report can be viewed under `<PROJECT-NAME>/target/site/jacoco/index.html`.

For the dependency checker report, run:

```text
./mvnw clean install -Powasp-dependency-check
```

The generated report can be viewed under `<PROJECT-NAME>/target/dependency-check.html`.

#### MUTATION TESTING

PIT mutation testing is used to generate mutation tests (see <https://pitest.org/> for details).
The mutation coverage goal analyses all classes in the codebase that match the target tests and target class filters.
To run it:

```text
./mvnw org.pitest:pitest-maven:mutationCoverage
```

The generated report can be viewed under â€“ `<PROJECT-NAME>/target/pit-reports/YYYYMMDDHHMI`

### RUNNING API TESTS

Set an environment variable `BASE_URL` (e.g. if testing locally set it to <http://localhost:9000>)

From project path `<>PROJECT-NAME>/api-tests` to run all tests, use

```text
./mvnw clean verify
```

To run the Smoke tests independently, use

```text
mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.options="--tags @Smoke"
```

and to run the Functional tests independently, use

```text
mvn clean verify -Dcucumber.options="--tags @Functional"
```

### USING A DOCKER IMAGE

From the `<PROJECT-NAME>/java` folder, build a Docker image using e.g. the command below:

   ```text
   docker build --tag stacks:1.0 .
   ```

This uses the `Dockerfile` in this folder to generate the Docker image.

If you have an `.m2` directory in the `java/` folder, the Docker build will attempt to copy the files inside the container and use the cached versions.

Once the Docker image is created, you can then run a Docker container based on this image using e.g.

   ```text
   docker run -p 9000:9000 -e AZURE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY -e AZURE_COSMOSDB_KEY stacks:1.0
   ```

which passes in the two required environment variables from your own environment.

#### SWAGGER/OAS

- Automatically generated for the project. Go to [Swagger Index](http://localhost:9000/swagger/index.html) to view.
- Swagger Json is here: [Swagger Json](http://localhost:9000/swagger/oas.json)

#### HEALTH CHECK

- Available at: [health check](http://localhost:9000/health)
(This can also be configured to run on another port)

## USING THE SCAFFOLDING CLI TO CREATE A JAVA SPRINGBOOT PROJECT TEMPLATE

The Amido Stacks Scaffolding CLI can be used to create a fully-functional and deployable project from a template, in a variety of flavours.
It includes tests (unit, integration), together with infrastructure and deployment definitions. All by running from your CLI.

We use npx to execute and create the
[template-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@amidostacks/scaffolding-cli)
[npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).

We are supporting and running [node@12](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
Please ensure that your local environment has the correct version [installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To run the Scaffolding CLI, use the following commands

```text
npx @amidostacks/scaffolding-cli@latest run -i  
```

You will be asked a number of questions. Based on the answers, your ready-to-build project template will be produced.

An example is shown in the video below.
